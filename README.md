'Clear All Markers' for CodeRush
======
A simple plugin which provides a single command for eliminating all current markers in the system.

Setup
======
[Bind the "ClearAllMarkers" command to a key](http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/rorybecker/archive/2010/10/05/binding-keys-in-coderush.aspx). I chose to bind to '**ESC**'

Usage
======
  * Activate any time you like.
    * All markers should disappear.
    * Your caret should not move.

Why did I build this
